```
***Types of Retrieval Methods:***<br>
1. Expedited Retrieval	--> within 1-5 minutes<br>
2. Standard Retrieval	--> within 3-5 hours.<br>
3. Bulk Retrieval	--> within 5-12 hours<br>

***3. Glacier Deep Archive: Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with the retrieval of hours<br>
As the data is not available for immediate access, we need to initiate a restore request using any retrieval method
```
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**       | Very rare          | Hours (12–48 hrs) | 99.99%       | Multi-AZ  | Cheapest of all              | 7–10 year retention, legal records     |
