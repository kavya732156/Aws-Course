EC2 : (Elastic Compute Cloud)
``` text 
EC2 is a core AWS compute service that offers on-demand, resizable virtual instances with configurable CPU,
memory, storage, and networking for running workloads.
```

```text
To create an EC2 instance, the following components are needed:

1. **AWS Account** – To access the AWS Management Console or CLI.
2. **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** – Defines the operating system and preinstalled software.
3. Instance Type – Specifies CPU, memory, and networking capacity.
4. Key Pair – Used for secure SSH/RDP access to the instance.
5. Security Group – Acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic.
6. VPC and Subnet – Determines the network where the instance is launched.
7. Storage (EBS) – Provides persistent block storage for the instance.
8. IAM Role (Optional) – Allows EC2 to access other AWS services securely.
```
