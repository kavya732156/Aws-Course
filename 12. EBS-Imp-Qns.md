1. What is Amazon EBS?
    ```
    Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a durable, high-performance block storage service designed to be attached to EC2 instances.
    It provides persistent storage, meaning data remains even after the instance is stopped or terminated (unless deleted).
    One-liner: “EBS is persistent block storage for EC2, used for OS, apps, and databases.”
    ```
2. What are the different volume types available for Amazon EBS?
    ```
    Amazon EBS provides 3 categories of volumes:
    SSD (Low latency, high IOPS): gp3 – General purpose and io2 / io1 – Provisioned IOPS (high-performance DBs)
    HDD (High throughput, low cost): st1 – Throughput optimized and sc1 – Cold HDD
    Legacy: standard – Magnetic (not recommended)
    ```
3. What is an EBS snapshot?
    ```
    An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time, incremental backup of an EBS volume stored in AWS-managed S3.
    It is used for backup, disaster recovery, and cloning volumes.
    One-liner:“Snapshot = backup of an EBS volume.”
    ```
4. How can you create an EBS snapshot?
    ```
    EC2 → Volumes → Select volume → Actions → Create snapshot
    ```
5. What is the difference between an EBS snapshot and an AMI?
   ```
    | Feature            | EBS Snapshot       | AMI                             |
    | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
    | Backup Type        | Backup of a volume | Template to launch EC2          |
    | Contains OS config | No                 | Yes                             |
    | Used for           | Backup / DR        | Launching instances             |
    | Includes           | Only volume data   | Root volume snapshot + metadata |
    | Bootable           |  No                | Yes                             |
    ```
6. How can you share an EBS snapshot with other AWS accounts?
    ```
    EC2 → Snapshots
    Select snapshot → Actions → Modify permissions and Add AWS Account ID and Save
    The other account can now create volumes from this snapshot.
    Note: Encrypted snapshots can be shared only if KMS key permissions are also shared.
    ```
7. Can you create an EBS volume from a snapshot in a different region?
   ```
   Not directly
   You must: Copy snapshot to target region  and Create volume from copied snapshot
   One-liner:“Snapshots are region-specific, but can be copied across regions.”
   ```
8. What is the maximum size of an EBS volume?
   ```
   16 TiB (16384 GiB)
   You can attach multiple volumes to one EC2 instance if more storage is needed.
   ```
9. What is the purpose of EBS volume encryption?
    ```
    EBS encryption protects data:
        At rest
        In transit (between EC2 & EBS)
        In snapshots
    It helps meet security and compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR).
    One-liner: “EBS encryption ensures data security at rest, in transit, and in backups.”
    ```

10. What is the difference between EBS encryption using AWS-managed keys and customer-managed keys?
| Feature          | AWS-Managed Key  | Customer-Managed Key                |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Who manages key  | AWS              | You (in KMS)                         |
| Rotation control | ❌ Limited       | ✅ Full control                      |
| Audit control    | ❌ Limited       | ✅ Full audit (CloudTrail)           |
| Compliance       | Basic             | Enterprise / regulated              |
| Use case         | Simple workloads  | Banking, healthcare, regulated apps |
