1. What is Amazon EBS?
    ```
    Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a durable, high-performance block storage service designed to be attached to EC2 instances.
    It provides persistent storage, meaning data remains even after the instance is stopped or terminated (unless deleted).
    One-liner: “EBS is persistent block storage for EC2, used for OS, apps, and databases.”
    ```
2. What are the different volume types available for Amazon EBS?
    ```
    Amazon EBS provides 3 categories of volumes:
    SSD (Low latency, high IOPS): gp3 – General purpose and io2 / io1 – Provisioned IOPS (high-performance DBs)
    HDD (High throughput, low cost): st1 – Throughput optimized and sc1 – Cold HDD
    Legacy: standard – Magnetic (not recommended)
    ```
3. What is an EBS snapshot?
    ```
    An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time, incremental backup of an EBS volume stored in AWS-managed S3.
    It is used for backup, disaster recovery, and cloning volumes.
    One-liner:“Snapshot = backup of an EBS volume.”
    ```
4. How can you create an EBS snapshot?
    ```
    EC2 → Volumes → Select volume → Actions → Create snapshot
    ```
5. What is the difference between an EBS snapshot and an AMI?
   ```
    | Feature            | EBS Snapshot       | AMI                             |
    | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
    | Backup Type        | Backup of a volume | Template to launch EC2          |
    | Contains OS config | No               | Yes                           |
    | Used for           | Backup / DR        | Launching instances             |
    | Includes           | Only volume data   | Root volume snapshot + metadata |
    | Bootable           |  No               | Yes                           |
    ```
