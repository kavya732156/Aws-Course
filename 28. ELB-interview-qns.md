***1. What is Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS?***
```
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets such as:
EC2 instances, Containers and IP addresses
It improves:  High availability, Fault tolerance, Scalability and Application performance.
Types of ELB:Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) and Classic Load Balancer (Legacy)
```
***2. How does ALB differ from NLB?***
```
| Feature    | ALB                     | NLB                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| OSI Layer  | 7 (Application)         | 4 (Transport)             |
| Protocol   | HTTP / HTTPS            | TCP / UDP / TLS           |
| Routing    | Path-based, Host-based  | IP + Port                 |
| Use Case   | Web apps, microservices | High-performance TCP apps |
| Static IP  | No                      | Yes                       |
| WebSockets | Yes                     | Limited                   |
ALB is smart (content-based routing)
NLB is ultra-fast (low latency, high throughput)
```
***3. Best Practices for Using ELB***
```
. Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
. Enable health checks
. Use Auto Scaling with target groups
. Enable Access Logs
. Use HTTPS with SSL certificates
. Enable deletion protection
. Use security groups properly
. Monitor with CloudWatch metrics
```
***4. How to Ensure ELB is Cost-Effective?***
```
. Choose correct load balancer type
. Remove unused load balancers
. Use Auto Scaling to avoid idle instances
. Monitor LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units) usage.
. Use HTTP instead of HTTPS internally (if secure VPC)
. Clean unused target groups
```
***5. Scenario: Slow Response Time Behind ALB***
```
Application behind : Application Load Balancer
Step-by-Step Troubleshooting:

. Check CloudWatch Metrics: TargetResponseTime, RequestCount , HTTPCode_ELB_5XX, HTTPCode_Target_5XX
. Enable and analyze ALB Access Logs (S3).
. Check: CPU/Memory usage on EC2, Network bottlenecks, Database latency
. Verify: Health check configuration and Target group health status
. Scale out if needed using Auto Scaling.
```
***6. Scenario: Route Traffic to Microservices Using ALB***
```
You can use: Path-Based Routing
Example:
. /users → User service target group
. /orders → Order service target group
. /payments → Payment service target group
In ALB: Create multiple target groups
Add listener rules:
. IF path = /users/* → forward to Users TG
. IF path = /orders/* → forward to Orders TG
This is perfect for microservices.
```
***7. Scenario: Traffic Spike from Marketing Campaign***
```
To handle sudden traffic:
. Attach ALB to Auto Scaling Group
. Configure dynamic scaling policies (CPU or request count based)
. Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing
. Increase deregistration delay if needed
. Use CloudFront for caching (optional)

Monitor: SurgeQueueLength, TargetResponseTime, RequestCount
ALB scales automatically, but backend must scale too.
```
***8. Scenario: Sticky Sessions Required***
```
For legacy apps needing session persistence:
In ALB:
. Go to Target Group
. Enable Stickiness
. Choose: Duration-based cookie and Application-based cookie
ALB will bind user session to same EC2 instance.
```
***9. Scenario: High Availability Across Multiple Regions***
```
ALB does NOT support native cross-region load balancing.
To achieve multi-region HA:
. Deploy ALB in Region-1
. Deploy ALB in Region-2
. Use Amazon Route 53

Configure:
. Latency-based routing OR
. Failover routing
Route 53 will send traffic to the healthiest region.
```
