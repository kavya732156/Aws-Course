***S3 Transfer Acceleration***<br>
By Enabling Transfer acceleration on S3 bucket, we can improve the upload and download speeds of the objects.<br>
*** Example***
. If any user far away from the S3 bucket is uploading the Object, the object will be uploaded to the nearest edge location first, and  
then it will be copied to the S3 bucket using AWS high speed low latency network.<br>
. S3 tarnsfer acceleration will generate an accelerated url, by using which the transfer will be accelerated.<br>
. If we transfer the data using the accelerated url, then it is chargeable.<br>
. No charge for just enabling the S3 transfer acceleration feature.<br>

***Exercise***<br>

***1) Create S3 Bucket & Enable Transfer Acceleration***
```
S3 → Create bucket
Bucket name: transferacceleration12feb2026
Region: Any (e.g., N. Virginia – us-east-1)
Create bucket
```

```
Enable Transfer Acceleration:
Open bucket and Go to Properties
Scroll to Transfer Acceleration
Click Edit → Enable → Save
Bucket name must be DNS-compliant.

***2) Note Down the Accelerated URL***
```
https://transferacceleration12feb2026.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/
```
***3) Use Speed Comparison Tool (Official AWS Tool)***<br>
```
Open this URL in your browser: https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html
Click “Start Test”
This tests:
. Normal S3 endpoint speed
. Transfer Acceleration speed
. From your location to multiple AWS Regions
```

***What You Should Observe (Expected Result)***
```
| Transfer Type            | Result                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Normal S3                | Slower (public internet path) |
| S3 Transfer Acceleration | Faster (AWS edge + backbone)  |
```

***Amazon S3 Object Lock***
```
. Prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed time
. Helps meet compliance / regulatory requirements (WORM – Write Once Read Many)
. Must be enabled at bucket creation time (can’t turn it on later)
. You can set retention periods per object or as a bucket default
. Supports Legal Hold (no expiry until removed)
. Works with S3 Versioning (mandatory)
. Even root user can’t delete locked objects (in Compliance mode)
. No extra charge for Object Lock feature (you pay for storage)
```
