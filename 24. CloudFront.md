***CloudFront***<br>
```
. Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services.
. It delivers content (websites, APIs, videos, images, etc.) to users with low latency and high transfer speeds by caching content at edge locations worldwide.
. CloudFront is a Global Service.
. The data from the origin will be cached at the edge locations, and the users can get the data from the nearest edge location.
. After a Time-to-Live [TTL], data from the edge location will be automatically invalidated, and a fresh copy of the data will be cached from the origin.
. If we want to update the content in the edge location instantly without waiting for the TTL, we have to use Manual Invalidation.
. Manual invalidation is available at an additional charges, charges are based on the invalidation paths
```
***How CloudFront Works***
```
A user requests content (example: website image).
The request goes to the nearest Edge Location.
If cached → content is returned immediately.
If not cached → CloudFront fetches from the Origin (like S3 or EC2).
Content is cached at the edge for future requests.
```
***Main Components of CloudFront***
```
1. Distribution : A configuration that tells CloudFront: Where the origin is and What content to cache and Security settings
Two types of distributions: Web Distribution (HTTP/HTTPS) and RTMP Distribution (legacy, for media streaming)
2. Origin : The source of the original content. Example: Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Load Balancer and Custom HTTP server
3. Edge Locations : Data centers where content is cached globally.
4. Cache Behavior Controls: Path pattern , TTL (Time to Live), Allowed HTTP methods and Forwarding headers/cookies
```
***CloudFront with OAI (Origin Access Identity) vs Without OAI***
```
1. Without OAI : S3 bucket must be public. and Anyone with S3 URL can access content.
2. With OAI : S3 bucket remains private. , Only CloudFront can access S3. and More secure (recommended method).
```
***Common Use Cases***
```
. Hosting static websites
. Streaming videos
. API acceleration
. Protecting backend servers
. Global application delivery
```
***CloudFront advantages:***
```
Fast, Secure, Scalable, Globally distributed, Cost-efficient and Highly available
