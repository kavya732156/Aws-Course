***Bucket Policies***<br>
Bucket policies are resource-based JSON policies attached to an S3 bucket to control access to the bucket and its objects, 
commonly used for cross-account access and public access use cases.
1.  Is a policy which we can apply on the S3 buckets.
2.  is also written in the JSON format.
3.  We can use policy Generator to create the required bucket policy.
4.  Bucket policy allows the users to access the objects from the S3 bucket based on the permissions which we included in the bucket policy.<br>

***Note: Bucket policies don't apply to objects owned by other accounts.***

***Task***<br>

***(a) Create S3 Bucket in N. Virginia (Public by Policy)***
```
Bucket name: bucketpolicy-13-feb-2026
Region: N. Virginia (us-east-1)
While creating bucket:
Block all public access → Disable and ACLs → Disabled (recommended)
Create bucket
Since ACLs are disabled, we’ll use only Bucket Policy to make content public.
