***Life Cycle Rules***<br>
S3 Lifecycle rules automatically transition or delete objects over time to optimize cost and manage data retention.<br>
Versioning is not mandatory to enable on the S3 bucket, but if the bucket is versioned then we need to create a separate life cycle rule for the "non-current versions"<br>
Sequence of the Storage classed for life cycle rule<br>
Standard, Standard-IA, Intelligent-Tier, OneZone-IA, Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive and Expire
