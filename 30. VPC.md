***VPC: Virtual Private Cloud***:<br>
→ Vpc is virtual isolated network creating in the Cloud<br>
→ By Default, AWS will provide a default vpc in every region at the time of aws account creation.<br>
→ As Per Requirement, we can create VPC in every region and we call those VPCs are Custom VPC.<br>
→ In Virtual Isolated Network  you can launch resources and connect to the resources privately.<br>
***COMPONENTS OF VPC:***
```
SUBNET
IGW→ Internet Gateway
ROUTE TABLE
NAT GATEWAY
Nat Instance
VPC Endpoints
Flow Logs
Vpc Peering
Transit Gateway
``` 

***1. Subnet***
```
Subnets divide VPC into smaller networks.
2 Types : Public Subnet and Privte Subnet.
1. Public Subnet : Has route to Internet Gateway
   Used for: Web servers , Bastion host and Load Balancer
2. Private Subnet : No direct internet access
   Used for: Database and Backend servers
```
***2. Internet Gateway (IGW)***
```
Allows communication between VPC and internet.
Without IGW → No internet access.
Internet Gatway is a gateway which can make any subnet as a Public subnet.
Note: we can attach only 1 internet gateway to any vpc
```
***3.Route Table***
```
Route Table Will contains the routes which are required to establish communication for the subnets.
Route: Provide one path to reach the destination.
AWS will provide a default Route Table Called “Main Route Table”
Main Route Table will act as a Private Route Table.
When You attach IGW in the  Public RT With the Subnets become Public Subnets.

VPC Sizing : In Amazon Web Services, you must assign a CIDR block when creating a VPC.
. VPC Size : Example: 10.0.0.0/16 , /16 = 65,536 IP addresses and AWS allows VPC sizes from /16 to /28
. Subnet Size : Example: /24 , /24 = 256 IPs and AWS reserves 5 IPs → 251 usable IPs
. Private IP Ranges (RFC1918) : 10.0.0.0/8 → 16M IPs, 172.16.0.0/12 → 1M IPs and 192.168.0.0/16 → 65K IPs
. IP Types : Private IP → Internal communication, Public IP → Internet access and Elastic IP → Static public IP
