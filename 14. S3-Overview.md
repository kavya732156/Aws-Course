***What Is Object Based Storage?***<br>
Object-based storage stores data as objects instead of files or blocks.<br>
In Aws, we have S3 Service,Which is a Object Based Storage.

***S3 (Simple Storage Service)***<br>
```
Amazon S3 is AWS’s object-based storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere over the internet.
It stores data as objects inside buckets and is designed for:
Massive scale, High durability, Low cost and Easy access via HTTP/API
S3 is a safe place to store the files.
It is Object-based storage, i.e., you can store Images, word files, pdf files, etc.
S3 doesn't support as a storage for EC2 instances.

Key Points of S3 Service
1. Bucket: A container for objects, Globally unique name, Created in a region
           Example: my-app-logs-bucket
2. Object: A file stored in S3, Max size: 5 TB
           Each object has: Data and Metadata and Key (name)
```
***The main components of Amazon S3 include***
1. Bucket: A bucket is a container for storing objects in Amazon S3.
           Every object is contained within a bucket. Buckets have globally unique names across all of AWS.
2. Object: An object is the basic unit of storage in Amazon S3.
           It consists of data, metadata, and a key. The key is a unique identifier within a bucket. Objects can range from 0 bytes to 5 terabytes in size.
3. Key: A key is a unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
           The combination of a bucket, a key, and the version ID uniquely identifies each object in Amazon S3.
4. Metadata: Metadata provides additional information about an object, such as the content type, creation date,
           and custom metadata. Metadata is a set of name-value pairs associated with the object.
5. Storage Class: Storage classes define the durability, availability, and pricing of the stored objects.
           Amazon S3 offers multiple storage classes, including STANDARD, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, ONEZONE_IA, GLACIER, and DEEP_ARCHIVE, each designed for different use cases.
6. Region: A region is a geographical area where Amazon S3 stores data. Buckets can be created in specific regions to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory            requirements.
7. Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are used to manage access to objects and buckets.
           They define which AWS accounts or users have permission to perform certain actions (e.g., read, write) on the objects.
8. Bucket Policies: Bucket policies are JSON-based policies that define permissions for buckets and the objects within them.
           These policies can be used to grant or deny access to specific AWS accounts or even anonymous users.
9. Access Points: Access points are unique hostnames created by customers to route requests to their buckets.
           They simplify managing data access at scale and can be used to enforce access policies.
10. Transfer Acceleration: Transfer Acceleration uses the CloudFront globally distributed edge locations to accelerate uploads to Amazon S3.
           It enables faster data transfers for large objects. <br>

***Features &Benefits***
Amazon S3 provides highly durable, scalable, secure, and cost-effective object storage with features like versioning, lifecycle management, encryption, replication, and static website hosting. <br>
Versioning: Allows multiple versions of an object to be stored in the same bucket.<br>
Lifecycle Management: Automates the transition of objects between storage classes or deletion after a specified period.<br>

***Common Use Cases of Amazon S3***
1. Static Website Hosting : Host HTML/CSS/JS directly on S3.<br>
   Example: Portfolio website, Landing pages and Product docs<br>
2. Backup & Restore: Store backups of: Databases, EC2 snapshots (indirectly) and Application backups<br>
   Example: Daily DB dump → S3 and Terraform state backend<br>
3. Data Lake / Big Data : Central storage for analytics.<br>
   Example: Store logs → Analyze with Athena and Store raw data → Process with Glue, EMR <br>
4. Media Storage & Streaming : Store images, videos, audio files.<br>
   Example: YouTube-like apps, E-learning platforms and CloudFront + S3 for fast delivery<br>
5. Log Storage : Store logs from: CloudTrail, ALB/ELB and Applications<br>
   Example: Audit logs and Security logs<br>
6. Disaster Recovery (DR) : Use Cross-Region Replication.<br>
   Example: Copy data from Mumbai → Singapore and DR for business continuity<br>
7. Big Data Analytics: S3 can be used as a data lake for storing and analyzing large datasets.
8. Content Distribution: S3 integrates with Amazon CloudFront to deliver content globally with low latency.
9. Mobile and IoT Applications: S3 can store and serve content for mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

***(FAQ) Naming Rules for the S3 bucket:***
```
Length must be between 3 and 63 characters
Bucket name must be unique across the globe
Must not contain uppercase letters
No special characters except. (period) - (Dash)
Must start and end with either a lowercase letter or a number
Cannot use consecutive periods (ex: s3..bucket)
Name must not represent an IP address ( ex: 10.11.21.13)
```
