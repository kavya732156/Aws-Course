***File Level Storage***<br>
--> File Level Storage is a type of storage that allows data to be stored and retrieved at the File Level.<br>
--> It is typically used for shared access to files and directories across multiple systems within the Network.<br>

 ***AWS Is Providing Two Different File Level Services, They Are***
 1. ***EFS***: Elastic File System—> Linux OS—-> NFSv4–Network File System Protocol (2049)
 2. ***FSX***: Windows OS —> SMB protocol→ Server Message Block Protocol.<br>

***Elastic File System - EFS***<br>
1. Amazon EFS Service is a Fully Managed Shared File System, Serverless, Scalable Storage Provided By AWS.
2. If You want to Share Files Across Multiple Servers We are Going to use EFS.
3. Using EFS We can Create a File System For Linux OS Servers Only.
4. To Share The File System We are using NFS Protocol (NFSv4)
5. EFS is a network-based storage system, which can use NFSV4 Protocol (2049).
6. EFS can automatically Grow and shrink based on the data which we store(as per usage), No need to Pre-provision.
7. EFS can be attached to multiple Instances at a time.
8. EFS can be mounted to the Linux EC2 instances.
9. While creating the EFS, Mount targets will be created in each selected availability zone.
10. Mount Target is used to mount the EFS to the instances in the specific availability zone

***Advantages and Benefits Of EFS***
1. Scalable & Elasticity
2. Fully Managed
3. Highly Available & Reliable
4. Serverless
5. Supports NFS Protocol <br>

***Use Cases of EFS:***<br>
1. Shared Access
2. Big Data Analytics
3. Container Storage
4. Development And Testing Env.
5. Caching & Web Server Configuration
6. Website Hosting.<br>

***STEP 1 – Create 2 EC2 Instances in Different AZs***<br>
```
***Instance 1***
Name: web-server-1, AMI: Amazon Linux 2, Instance Type: t2.micro, Key pair: select your .pem
Network: Default VPC, Subnet: us-east-1a (or any AZ), Auto-assign Public IP: Enable, 
Security Group: Create web-sg--> SSH – 22 – My IP , HTTP – 80 – 0.0.0.0/0

***Instance 2***<br>
Name: web-server-2 , Same settings, Subnet: us-east-1b (different AZ) and Same web-sg
```

***STEP 2 – Create NFS Security Group for EFS***<br>

EC2 → Security Groups → Create SG
Name : efs-nfs-sg
Inbound Rules:
```
| Type | Port | Source |
| ---- | ---- | ------ |
| NFS  | 2049 | web-sg |
```
This allows EC2 to talk to EFS

***STEP 3 – Create EFS File System*** <br>
AWS Console → EFS → Create File System
```
Name: my-efs, VPC: Default VPC
Customize: Add mount targets in both AZs (us-east-1a and us-east-1b)
Security Group: efs-nfs-sg
Create
Copy your File System ID:

***STEP 4 – Connect to Both EC2 Servers and Install Apache + EFS Utils (Both Servers)***
