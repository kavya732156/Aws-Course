***Gateway Load Balancer:***<br>
. A Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is a special type of load balancer in Amazon Web Services used to deploy, scale, and 
manage third-party virtual appliances like firewalls, IDS/IPS, deep packet inspection systems, etc.<br>
. Gateway Load Balancer works at Layer 3 (Network Layer).<br>

***Classic Load Balancer:***<br>
. A Classic Load Balancer (CLB) is the original load balancer service provided by Amazon Web Services.<br>
. It is part of the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) family and is mainly used for legacy applications<br>
. It works at: Layer 4 (Transport Layer) → TCP and Layer 7 (Application Layer) → HTTP / HTTPS
. It is older compared to: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB) and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

***Key Features of CLB***<br>
1. Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
2. Health checks
3. SSL termination
4. Sticky sessions (Session persistence)
5. Cross-zone load balancing <br>

***CLB vs ALB vs NLB***
```
| Feature                  | CLB   | ALB   | NLB  |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ---   | ---  |
| Layer                    | 4 & 7 | 7     | 4    |
| Path-based Routing       |  NO   | Yes   | NO   |
| Host-based Routing       |  NO   | Yes   | NO   |
| Static IP                |  NO   | NO    | Yes  |
| Recommended for New Apps |  NO   | Yes   | Yes  |
```
***Advantages Of ELB:***
1. High availability and fault tolerance for your application
2.  Automatic detection and routing of traffic to healthy instances
3.  Scalability and flexibility for your applications
4.  Security features such as SSL/TLS encryption and certificate management <br>
***Use Cases of ELB :***
1.  E-commerce websites
2.  Gaming and media streaming applications
3.  IoT applications
4.  High-traffic websites and web applications.
