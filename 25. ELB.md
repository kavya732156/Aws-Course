***ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)***<br>
```
. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a service from Amazon Web Services that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.
. It helps improve: High Availability, Scalability, Fault Tolerance and Performance
. Target is the instance to which we need to redirect the traffic
. Target Group is used to maintain all the targets to which we need to send the traffic.
```
***Types of Load balancers under ELB***
```
1. Application Load Balancer  - ALB  → 2016
2. Network Load Balancer      - NLB → 2017
3. Gateway Load balancer      - GLB → 2019
4. Classic Load Balancer        - CLB  → Previous generation Load balancer → 2009
```
***1. Application Load Balancer- ALB***
```
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Best for web applications
Supports: Path-based routing and Host-based routing and WebSockets and Microservices
```
***Exercise***
***STEP 1: Launch 2 EC2 Instances (Different AZs – Mumbai)***
```
AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance
1. Instance 1:
  Name: Web-Server-1
  Region: Asia Pacific (Mumbai) – ap-south-1
  AMI: Amazon Linux 2
  Instance type: t2.micro
  Key pair: Select existing or create new
  VPC: Default VPC
  Subnet: Choose ap-south-1a
  Auto-assign Public IP: Enable
  Security Group: Allow HTTP (80) → 0.0.0.0/0 and Allow SSH (22) → Your IP andClick Launch

2. Instance 2 Configuration Repeat same steps but:
  Name: Web-Server-2
  Subnet: ap-south-1b andLaunch instance.

***STEP 2: Configure Web Server in Both Instances***
```
Instance 1:
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>This is Web Server 1</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html

Instance 2:

sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>This is Web Server 2</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

***STEP 3: Create Target Group***
```
Go to: EC2 → Target Groups → Create target group
Target type: Instances Name: ALB-TG
Protocol: HTTP and Port: 80 and VPC: Default VPC
Click Next
Register Instances Select both: Web-Server-1 and Web-Server-2 Click Include as pending
Click Create target group
```

***STEP 4: Create Application Load Balancer***
```
Go to: EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer
Select → Application Load Balancer
Configure ALB Name: My-ALB, Scheme: Internet-facing IP type: IPv4, VPC: Default VPC
Availability Zones: Select ap-south-1a and Select ap-south-1b
Security Group Allow: HTTP (80) → 0.0.0.0/0
Listener HTTP : 80
Forward to → Select your Target Group ALB-TG
Click Create Load Balancer
Wait for Status = Active
```

***STEP 5: Test ALB***
```
Go to: EC2 → Load Balancers
Copy the DNS Name and Paste in new browser tab:
Refresh multiple times You will see: This is Web Server 1 and This is Web Server 2
Load balancing is working

***1. Blue/Green Deployment***<br>
Blue/Green Deployment is a release strategy where you run two identical production environments and switch traffic between them with zero downtime.
```
| Environment | Purpose                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
|    Blue     | Current live production    |
|    Green    | New version of application |
```
***How to Implement in AWS (Simple ALB Method)***
```
Create two Target Groups: TG-Blue and TG-Green
Attach Blue instances to TG-Blue
Attach Green instances to TG-Green
In ALB: Listener → Forward to TG-Blue (initially)
When ready: Change listener → Forward to TG-Green
Done
```
***Advantages***<br>
1. Zero downtime deployment
2. Instant rollback
3. Safe production release
4. Easy testing before go-live
5. Reduced deployment risk

***Disadvantages***<br>
1. Double infrastructure cost
2. Database schema sync complexity
3. Slightly higher setup effort

***2.  Canary Deployment***<br>
Canary Deployment is a release strategy where a new version of an application is released to a small percentage of users first, while the majority continue using the stable version.<br>
It is commonly implemented in AWS using: Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon EC2, AWS CodeDeploy and Amazon Route 53<br>
new version is stable before a full release.
***Use Cases:***<br>
Testing new features with real user traffic.<br>
Verifying performance and reliability under limited usage.<br>
Incremental rollouts to reduce deployment risks.<br>
