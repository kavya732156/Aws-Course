***1. What is EC2 User Data?***

- EC2 User Data is a mechanism to pass scripts or commands to an EC2 instance when it launches. It’s commonly used to automate instance configuration, 
  such as installing software, updating packages, or running initialization tasks.
- User Data is executed only at the first launch by default.
- userdata is also called as bootstrap scripts
- It can be shell scripts (#!/bin/bash), cloud-init directives (#cloud-config), or PowerShell scripts (for Windows instances).
- You can modify user data for instances, the instance must be in the stopped state.

***Shell scripts (Linux/Unix): Typically starts with #!/bin/bash***
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
echo "<h2>Installing httpd via Userdata script </h2>" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
```
***Troubleshooting userdata scripts in this files***
  -/var/log/cloud-init.log
  -/var/log/cloud-init-output.log

***Cloud-Init scripts (Linux): Starts with #cloud-config for advanced configuration***
  
  ```bash
cloud-init directives
#cloud-config
repo_update: true
repo_upgrade: all
    
packages:
- httpd
    
runcmd:
- [ sh, -c, 'echo "<h2>http install via Cloud Init Directives </h2>" > /var/www/html/index.html' ]
- systemctl start httpd
- sudo systemctl enable httpd
```
***MIME Multi-Part Scripts***

AWS EC2 User Data supports multi-part MIME scripts, which allows you to combine multiple types of scripts (shell, cloud-init, PowerShell, etc.) 
in a single User Data payload. This is useful when you want to run different scripts or use multiple interpreters in one instance launch.

```bash
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="MIMEBOUNDARY"

--MIMEBOUNDARY
Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"

#cloud-config
packages:
  - nginx

--MIMEBOUNDARY
Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx

--MIMEBOUNDARY--
```
