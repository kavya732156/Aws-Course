1. What is Amazon EBS?
    ```
    Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a durable, high-performance block storage service designed to be attached to EC2 instances.
    It provides persistent storage, meaning data remains even after the instance is stopped or terminated (unless deleted).
    One-liner: “EBS is persistent block storage for EC2, used for OS, apps, and databases.”
