***S3 Transfer Acceleration***<br>
By Enabling Transfer acceleration on S3 bucket, we can improve the upload and download speeds of the objects.<br>
*** Example***
. If any user far away from the S3 bucket is uploading the Object, the object will be uploaded to the nearest edge location first, and  
then it will be copied to the S3 bucket using AWS high speed low latency network.<br>
. S3 tarnsfer acceleration will generate an accelerated url, by using which the transfer will be accelerated.<br>
. If we transfer the data using the accelerated url, then it is chargeable.<br>
. No charge for just enabling the S3 transfer acceleration feature.<br>

***Exercise***<br>

***1) Create S3 Bucket & Enable Transfer Acceleration***
```
S3 → Create bucket
Bucket name: transferacceleration12feb2026
Region: Any (e.g., N. Virginia – us-east-1)
Create bucket
```

```
Enable Transfer Acceleration:
Open bucket and Go to Properties
Scroll to Transfer Acceleration
Click Edit → Enable → Save
Bucket name must be DNS-compliant.
```

***2) Note Down the Accelerated URL***
```
https://transferacceleration12feb2026.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/
```
***3) Use Speed Comparison Tool (Official AWS Tool)***<br>
```
Open this URL in your browser: https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html
Click “Start Test”
This tests:
. Normal S3 endpoint speed
. Transfer Acceleration speed
. From your location to multiple AWS Regions
```

***What You Should Observe (Expected Result)***
```
| Transfer Type            | Result                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Normal S3                | Slower (public internet path) |
| S3 Transfer Acceleration | Faster (AWS edge + backbone)  |
```

***Amazon S3 Object Lock***
```
. Prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed time
. Helps meet compliance / regulatory requirements (WORM – Write Once Read Many)
. Must be enabled at bucket creation time (can’t turn it on later)
. You can set retention periods per object or as a bucket default
. Supports Legal Hold (no expiry until removed)
. Works with S3 Versioning (mandatory)
. Even root user can’t delete locked objects (in Compliance mode)
. No extra charge for Object Lock feature (you pay for storage)
```

***Key Features of S3 Object Lock***
1. Prevents Object Deletion or Modification – Once enabled, the object cannot be deleted or overwritten during the retention period.
2. Two Retention Modes:
   ```
   Governance Mode: Allows certain users (with special permissions) to override the lock.
   Compliance Mode: No one, including the root user, can modify or delete the object until the retention period expires.
   ```
3. Retention Period – You can specify a fixed time (days or years) during which the object is locked.

```
| Mode      | Can be deleted before retention expires? | Who can override?              | Use Case         |                  
|Compliance |  No                                      | Nobody (even root)             | Regulatory compliance, audits |
|Governance |  No (by default)                         | Admins with special permission | Internal policies, flexibility |
```
***Legal Hold vs Retention***
```
| Feature     | Retention Period                | Legal Hold                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Expiry date |  Yes                            |  No expiry                           |
| Time-based  |  Yes                            |  Not time-based                      |
| Removable?  |  Not until expiry (Compliance)  |  Can be removed by authorized users  |
| Use case    | Records retention policy        | Ongoing investigation / lawsuit      |
```

***How to Enable (Console)***<br>

You must enable Object Lock when creating the bucket:
```
S3 → Create bucket
Expand Advanced settings and Enable Object Lock and Acknowledge warning
Create bucket
Versioning is auto-enabled
```
