***STEP 3 – Make the Object Public (So URL Works)***
```
Click your uploaded object (e.g., .jpg)
Go to Permissions tab
Option A (Quick demo – Public Read)
Edit Object ACL : Enable Read for Everyone (public access) and Save changes
For real projects, use Bucket Policy instead of public ACLs. This is fine for lab/demo.
