***Versioning:***<br>
S3 Versioning keeps multiple versions of the same object in a bucket.<br>
Every time you upload a file with the same name, S3 stores it as a new version instead of overwriting the old one.<br>
Think of it like file history / undo for S3.<br>
```
Keeps multiple versions of the same object
Prevents accidental overwrite & delete
Delete adds a “delete marker” (old versions still exist)
Old versions can be restored anytime
MFA Delete can protect version deletions
Once enabled, can’t be disabled (only suspended)
Applies only to new objects (old ones stay unversioned)
Costs increase (each version is billed)
Use Lifecycle rules to clean up old versions
Works with replication (CRR/SRR replicates versions)
```
