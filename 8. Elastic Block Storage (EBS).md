***Elastic Block Storage (EBS)***
Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances. Think of it as a virtual hard drive attached to an EC2 instance.
Unlike S3, EBS is persistent storage, meaning data remains even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated (unless deleted).

***Key Points:***
Provides high-performance, low-latency storage.
Can be attached to one EC2 instance at a time (except multi-attach for io2 volumes).
Ideal for databases, applications, and file systems.

***How does EBS work?***

Create an EBS volume in the same availability zone (AZ) as your EC2 instance.
Attach the volume to your EC2 instance.
Format and mount the volume in the instance (Linux: mkfs + mount; Windows: Initialize and assign drive letter).
Use the volume like a local disk.
Snapshots can be taken to backup volumes to S3.

***Types of Volumes:***
***1. Root Volume***
```text
The root volume is the primary storage volume that contains the operating system and boots the EC2 instance.
Every EC2 instance must have a root volume.

***Key Points:***
Typically created from an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
Can be EBS-backed (persistent) or instance-store-backed (ephemeral).
Default device: /dev/xvda (Linux) or C: drive (Windows).
You can resize or create a snapshot of the root volume.

***Use Cases:***
Holds OS, system files, and essential applications.
Can be replaced/upgraded by creating a new AMI from the root volume snapshot.
```
***2. EBS Volume (Additional/Attached Volumes)***
```text
Any additional block-level storage attached to an EC2 instance beyond the root volume.
Always EBS-backed.

***Key Points:***
Can be attached/detached from running EC2 instances.
Supports encryption, snapshots, resizing, and high availability.
Can be used for databases, logs, file storage, or application data.
Can be attached to multiple instances (with io2 multi-attach) if needed.

***Use Cases:***
Storing application data separate from OS.
Persistent storage for critical workloads.
Data sharing or migration between instances using snapshots.
```
***EBS Performance Factors***
```text
1. IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) – Measures the volume's ability to handle read/write operations.
2. Throughput (MB/s) – Measures data transfer speed.
3. Queue Length – Number of pending I/O operations.
4. Latency – Time taken to process requests.
```
***Common EBS Operations***
***1. Create an EBS Volume***
```text
Open AWS Console
Go to EC2 → Elastic Block Store → Volumes and Click Create volume
Choose: Volume type (gp3 / io2 / st1 / sc1), Size (GB), Availability Zone (same AZ as EC2), Encryption (optional – recommended)
Click Create volume
```
***2. Attach EBS Volume to EC2***
```text
EC2 → Volumes
Select the volume, Click Actions → Attach volume
Choose:nstance ID and Device name (e.g., /dev/sdf) and Click Attach
```
***3. Mount the volume***
```text
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /mnt/ebs
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/ebs
```
***4. Taking a Snapshot of an EBS Volume***
```text
Select the volume, click Create Snapshot
Store snapshots in Amazon S3
Use snapshots to restore or create new volumes
```

***Use Cases***
1. Web Applications – Persistent storage for EC2 instances.
2. Databases – Storing structured and unstructured data.
3. Big Data Processing – Large-scale analytics and logs.
4. Disaster Recovery – Backup and restore using snapshots.

***EBS provide 3 Categories of storage Drives***

***1. SSD (Solid State Drives) – Low Latency, High IOPS*** <br>
        Stands For Solid State Drive
        SSD is Durable, Faster, More Energy Efficient<br>
        It is used for Performing tasks like Booting & Loading Applications.<br>
        Very Fast Processing for Low Data<br>
        Small in Size <br>
        SSD’s are Most Costlier than HDD the performance of the SSD is measured in terms of IOPS [ Input & Output operations per second].<br>

  ***Types:***<br>
  1. ***gp3 / gp2 → General Purpose SSD*** : Which is Used For Normal Access <br>
         gp2--- 100 IOPS > 16000 IOPS = 16TB<br>
         gp3.... 3000 IOPS > 16000 IOPS = 16TB<br>
     
  2. ***io2 / io1 → Provisioned IOPS SSD*** : Which is Used For rapid access<br>
         io1- 100 IOps > 64000 Iops =64 tb <br>
         io2 - 100 IOps > 64000 Iops = 64 tb<br>
         io2 Block express r5-b instance type--more than 64000 Iops > 64TB<br>

***2. HDD (Hard Disk Drives) – High Throughput, Low Cost***<br>
           HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive<br>
           It is a Type of Storage Device.<br>
           Compare to SSD, HDD are Slower & Less Energy Efficient but they are tend to affordable at Higher Storage Capacities<br>
           Big in Size<br>
           Low Cost disk drives<br>

   ***Types:***<br>
   ***1. st1 → Throughput Optimized HDD***<br>
           A low-cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.<br>
           Min: 125 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB.<br>
           Throughput  Baseline starts with 40 MiB/s per TiB.<br>

   ***2. sc1 → Cold HDD***<br>
           The lowest-cost HDD design for less frequently accessed workloads.<br>
           Min: 125 GiB, Max: 16384 GiB.<br>
           Throughput  Baseline starts with 12 MiB/s per TiB.<br>

***3. Magnetic (Standard) – Legacy (Deprecated-ish)***<br>
           Old generation EBS (avoid for new workloads)<br>
           Lowest cost (old days)<br>
           High latency<br>
           Low performance<br>
           Not recommended for new setups<br>

   ***Type:***<br>
   1. standard (magnetic)
        usecase : Workloads where data is infrequently accessed
        Volume size	: 1 GiB-1 TiB<br>
        Max IOPS per volume	40–200<br>
        Max throughput per volume	40–90 MiB/s<br>
