***Volume management**<br>
It's the process of increasing the size of the EBS volume and changing the type of the EBS Volume
We cannot reduce the size of the existing EBS Volume<br>
We cannot modify the volume twice in a 6 hour window<br>

1) Increase the volume size of 25GB Volume (1gb-gp2-1a) to 30GB which is already attached to the SERVER3-A.<br>

***Instance Store:***<br>
   Instance Store is a temporary Storage for Few EC2 instances types only.<br>
   it is not persistent Storage, it is temporary.<br>
   we can also call it as Emphemeral Storage.<br>
   whenever we stop the Ec2 instance, we will lose all the data from the instance store.<br>
   Instance Store can be attached at the time of EC2 instance creation only.<br>
   We cannot attach a new Instance store to an existing EC2 instance.<br>
   Instance Store Volumes are Free.<br>
