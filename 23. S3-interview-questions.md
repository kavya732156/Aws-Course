***1. What is the purpose of transitioning objects to Glacier in an S3 Lifecycle Rule?***
```
Transitioning objects to Glacier in a lifecycle rule reduces cost by automatically moving infrequently
accessed data to low-cost archival storage
. Reduce storage cost for rarely accessed data
. Long-term archiving (logs, backups, compliance data)
. Automated cost optimization over time
. Meet retention/compliance requirements
. Secure, durable storage for cold data
```

***2. How do you enable S3 Replication for a bucket?***
```
Steps
Enable Versioning on source bucket
Enable Versioning on destination bucket
Go to Source bucket → Management → Replication rules → Create rule
Choose Destination bucket (same or different region)
Select Scope (all objects / prefix / tags)
Allow AWS to create IAM role for replication
(Optional) Enable replicate delete markers
Save rule
```

***3. What is an S3 Lifecycle Rule & How to Create One?***
```
Definition
An S3 Lifecycle rule is used to automatically move objects to cheaper storage classes or delete them after a specified time.
Key points:
. Automates data management
. Reduces storage cost
. Time-based actions
. Can apply to whole bucket or prefix/tags
. Works with versioned buckets
. No extra cost for rules

How to Create an S3 Lifecycle Rule (Console)
Go to S3 → Bucket → Management → Lifecycle rules → Create rule
Give a rule name
Choose scope: All objects or Prefix/Tags
Add transitions (e.g., 30 days → Standard-IA, 90 days → Glacier)
(Optional) Add expiration (e.g., delete after 365 days) and Save rule
Lifecycle rules run once per day, not instantly.
```
